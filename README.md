# Decision Trees
Patient Classification and Predict Medication  

In this exercise we will use Decision Tree classification algorithm to build a model from historical data of patients, and their response to different medications. Then we will use the trained decision tree to predict the class of an unknown patient or to find a proper drug for a new patient.
